So, I found this Tailwind CSS, A utility-first CSS framework for
rapidly building custom designs. <br/> Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

I made this responsive blog site just in 5 minutes. You too can do so :)<br/><br/>
